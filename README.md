# How to install

### Jailbroken Devices

Add __[https://apt.fouadraheb.com](https://apt.fouadraheb.com)__ to your Cydia/Zebra/Sileo sources and download it from there. (Check [this page](https://appledb.dev/device-selection/) for more info on how to jailbreak your device if possible)

### Sideloading (No Jailbreak)

* (Option 1) Download IPA file from here and follow the below [Sideloading with AltStore](#sideloading-with-altstore) instructions to sign and install the app from your computer.

    | Application | Bundle | Version | Regram |
    | ------------------ |:---------:|:------:|:------:|
    | [Instagram][SL-IG] | com.burbn.instagram | 378.0.0 | 1.0.29 |
    | [Instagram - No-Plugins][SL-IG-NoPlugins] | com.burbn.instagram | 378.0.0 | 1.0.29 |
    | [Instagram - Duplicate][SL-IG-Duplicate] | com.fouadraheb.regram | 378.0.0 | 1.0.29 |
    | [Instagram - TrollStore][TS-IG] | com.burbn.instagram | 378.0.0 | 1.0.29 |

    <sup>If you have a paid certificate, you need to use original version and sign it with a Distribution/Ad-Hoc certificate to get notifications.</sup>
    
* (Option 2) You can get a paid subscription from a signing store where you can download the latest Regram directly from your device and have it available for 1 year instead of 7 days. I recommend using [https://flekstore.com)][flekstore-link] since they always have the latest official IPA from this page.

## Sideloading with AltStore

</summary>

### Requirements

1. A computer running macOS or Windows
2. Internet connection
3. Apple ID (email & password)
4. If you are on iOS 16, you may need to enable Developer Mode. (Settings > Privacy & Security > Developer Mode)

### AltStore

* Download and install AltServer from [here](https://altstore.io)

* Right-click on the AltServer icon with your phone connected and choose "Install AltStore", then the name of your phone. When prompted sign in with your Apple ID. Two-factor Authentication is supported, but app-specific passwords are not.

* Make sure no other Instagram with the same bundle identifier is installed. (com.burbn.instagram if you chose the original IPA or com.fouadraheb.regram for the duplicate)

* If you have AltStore Beta, you can add our AltStore source (https://altstore.fouadraheb.com) and download apps directly from AltStore.

* If you don't have access to AltStore sources, download the IPA file from the link above and copy it to your phone, using iCloud Drive, AirDrop, or any other method. Open AltStore and navigate to the "My Apps" tab. Choose the plus in the top right corner and open the IPA file. When prompted sign in with your Apple ID. Two-factor Authentication is supported, but app-specific passwords are not.

## Version History
You can check Regram's release notes from [this page][changelogs-link].<br/>
Some versions are released only for Jailbroken devices and later for Sideloading.

## FAQ
* If you receive "Please sign in with app-specific password" error, that's because you have 2-factor authentication enabled for your Apple ID. You have to go to Apple's website https://appleid.apple.com, log in with your account and create an app-specific password to use as your Apple ID password.
* Signing the app with a non-developer account will have it expire in 7 days, but AltStore automates re-signing as long as it is connected to your PC.
* The app will not receive Push Notifications on Sideloading unless properly signed with a Distribution (Ad-Hoc) signing certificate (Except for TrollStore on supported devices).
